		  Existing approaches generally determine matches by
		  inferring subsumption relationships between a request and a
		  service specification, but may return poor results if
		  service profiles are overspecified or provide only partial
		  information. We present a two-staged consistency-based
		  matchmaking approach where services that potentially match
		  the request are identified in the first stage, these
		  services are queried for concrete information, and finally
		  this information is used to determine the matches. We
		  evaluate our matchmaking scheme in the context of the
		  Discovery II and Simple Composition scenario proposed by
		  the SWS Challenge group. Preliminary evaluation shows that
		  our approach is robust while handling overspecified
		  profiles, does not return false positives, and is able to
		  handle partial information in service and requirements
		  specification.},

  abstract	= {Process mining is a discipline that aims at discovering,
		  monitoring and improving real-life processes by extracting
		  knowledge from event logs. Process discovery and
		  conformance checking are the two main process mining tasks.
		  Process discovery techniques can be used to learn a process
		  model from example traces in an event log, whereas the goal
		  of conformance checking is to compare the observed behavior
		  in the event log with the modeled behavior. In this paper,
		  we propose an approach based on temporal logic query
		  checking, which is in the middle between process discovery
		  and conformance checking. It can be used to discover those
		  LTL-based business rules that are valid in the log, by
		  checking against the log a (user-defined) class of rules.
		  The proposed approach is not limited to provide a boolean
		  answer about the validity of a business rule in the log,
		  but it rather provides valuable diagnostics in terms of
		  traces in which the rule is satisfied (witnesses) and
		  traces in which the rule is violated (counterexamples). We
		  have implemented our approach as a proof of concept and
		  conducted a wide experimentation using both synthetic and
		  real-life logs.},

  abstract	= {Process discovery is one of the main branches of process
		  mining that allows the user to build a process model
		  representing the process behavior as recorded in the logs.
		  Standard process discovery techniques produce as output a
		  procedural process model (e.g., a Petri net). Recently,
		  several approaches have been developed to derive
		  declarative process models from logs and have been proven
		  to be more suitable to analyze processes working in
		  environments that are less stable and predictable. However,
		  a large part of these techniques are focused on the
		  analysis of the control flow perspective of a business
		  process. Therefore, one of the challenges still open in
		  this field is the development of techniques for the
		  analysis of business processes also from other
		  perspectives, like data, time, and resources. In this
		  paper, we present a full-fledged approach for the discovery
		  of multi-perspective declarative process models from event
		  logs that allows the user to discover declarative models
		  taking into consideration all the information an event log
		  can provide. The approach has been implemented and
		  experimented in real-life case studies.},

  abstract = {Business processes today are supported by process-driven service oriented
	architectures. Due to the increasing importance of compliance of
	an organization with regulatory requirements and internal policies,
	there is a need for appropriate techniques to monitor organizational
	information systems as they execute business processes. Event-based
	monitoring of processes is one of the ways to provide runtime process-state
	information. This type of monitoring, however, has limitations mostly
	related to the type and amount of information available in events
	and pro- cess engines. We propose a novel approach ? model-aware
	monitoring of business processes ? to address these limitations.
	Emitted events contain unique identifiers of models that can be retrieved
	dynamically during runtime from a model-aware repository and service
	environment (MORSE). The size of the events is kept small and patterns
	of events that signify interesting occurrences are identified through
	complex event processing and are signaled to interesting components
	such as a business intelligence. To illustrate our approach we present
	an industry case study where we have applied this generic infrastructure
	for the compliance monitoring of business processes},

  month = apr,
  abstract = {Business Process Compliance {(BPC)} has gained significant momentum
	in research and practice during the last years. Although many approaches
	address {BPC}, they mostly assume the existence of some kind of unified
	base of process constraints and focus on their verification over
	the business processes. However, it remains unclear how such an inte-
	grated process constraint base can be built up, even though this
	con- stitutes the essential prerequisite for all further compliance
	checks. In addition, the heterogeneity of process constraints has
	been neglected so far. Without identification and separation of process
	constraints from domain rules as well as unification of process constraints,
	the success- ful {IT} support of {BPC} will not be possible. In this
	technical report we introduce a unified representation framework
	that enables the identifica- tion of process constraints from domain
	rules and their later unification within a process constraint base.
	Separating process constraints from domain rules can lead to significant
	reduction of compliance checking effort. Unification enables consistency
	checks and optimizations as well as maintenance and evolution of
	the constraint base on the other side.},

	major challenge in literature and practice. Although process instances
	are, for example, often required to share resources such as printers
	or centrifuges, the necessary instance synchronization is not supported
	by most process engines. While existing (scarcely supported) patterns
	deal with the intra-process synchronization of activities, a model
	for a more generic synchronization mechanism is still missing. The
	contribution of this paper is two-fold. (1) We introduce a generic
	model to describe the state transitions of process instances at runtime,
	and based on this model (2) define a subscription based event / voting
	mechanism that enables arbitrary synchronization within and between
	running instances. In order to demonstrate the validity of our approach,
	we will conduct an extensive evaluation against existing synchronization
	patterns, as well as describe a generic rule engine prototype that
	implements the presented approach.},

  abstract = {Business processes today are supported by process-driven service oriented
	architectures. Due to the increasing importance of compliance of
	an organization with regulatory requirements and internal policies,
	there is a need for appropriate techniques to monitor organizational
	information systems as they execute business processes. Event-based
	monitoring of processes is one of the ways to provide runtime process-state
	information. This type of monitoring, however, has limitations mostly
	related to the type and amount of information available in events
	and pro- cess engines. We propose a novel approach ? model-aware
	monitoring of business processes ? to address these limitations.
	Emitted events contain unique identifiers of models that can be retrieved
	dynamically during runtime from a model-aware repository and service
	environment (MORSE). The size of the events is kept small and patterns
	of events that signify interesting occurrences are identified through
	complex event processing and are signaled to interesting components
	such as a business intelligence. To illustrate our approach we present
	an industry case study where we have applied this generic infrastructure
	for the compliance monitoring of business processes},

  month = apr,
  abstract = {Business Process Compliance {(BPC)} has gained significant momentum
	in research and practice during the last years. Although many approaches
	address {BPC}, they mostly assume the existence of some kind of unified
	base of process constraints and focus on their verification over
	the business processes. However, it remains unclear how such an inte-
	grated process constraint base can be built up, even though this
	con- stitutes the essential prerequisite for all further compliance
	checks. In addition, the heterogeneity of process constraints has
	been neglected so far. Without identification and separation of process
	constraints from domain rules as well as unification of process constraints,
	the success- ful {IT} support of {BPC} will not be possible. In this
	technical report we introduce a unified representation framework
	that enables the identifica- tion of process constraints from domain
	rules and their later unification within a process constraint base.
	Separating process constraints from domain rules can lead to significant
	reduction of compliance checking effort. Unification enables consistency
	checks and optimizations as well as maintenance and evolution of
	the constraint base on the other side.},

	are, for example, often required to share resources such as printers

	by most process engines. While existing (scarcely supported) patterns
	deal with the intra-process synchronization of activities, a model
	for a more generic synchronization mechanism is still missing. The
	contribution of this paper is two-fold. (1) We introduce a generic
	model to describe the state transitions of process instances at runtime,
	and based on this model (2) define a subscription based event / voting
	mechanism that enables arbitrary synchronization within and between
	running instances. In order to demonstrate the validity of our approach,
	we will conduct an extensive evaluation against existing synchronization
	patterns, as well as describe a generic rule engine prototype that
	implements the presented approach.},

  abstract = {Business processes today are supported by process-driven service oriented
	architectures. Due to the increasing importance of compliance of
	an organization with regulatory requirements and internal policies,
	there is a need for appropriate techniques to monitor organizational
	information systems as they execute business processes. Event-based
	monitoring of processes is one of the ways to provide runtime process-state
	information. This type of monitoring, however, has limitations mostly
	related to the type and amount of information available in events
	and pro- cess engines. We propose a novel approach ? model-aware
	monitoring of business processes ? to address these limitations.
	Emitted events contain unique identifiers of models that can be retrieved
	dynamically during runtime from a model-aware repository and service
	environment (MORSE). The size of the events is kept small and patterns
	of events that signify interesting occurrences are identified through
	complex event processing and are signaled to interesting components
	such as a business intelligence. To illustrate our approach we present
	an industry case study where we have applied this generic infrastructure
	for the compliance monitoring of business processes},

  month = apr,
  abstract = {Business Process Compliance {(BPC)} has gained significant momentum
	in research and practice during the last years. Although many approaches
	address {BPC}, they mostly assume the existence of some kind of unified
	base of process constraints and focus on their verification over
	the business processes. However, it remains unclear how such an inte-
	grated process constraint base can be built up, even though this
	con- stitutes the essential prerequisite for all further compliance
	checks. In addition, the heterogeneity of process constraints has
	been neglected so far. Without identification and separation of process
	constraints from domain rules as well as unification of process constraints,
	the success- ful {IT} support of {BPC} will not be possible. In this
	technical report we introduce a unified representation framework
	that enables the identifica- tion of process constraints from domain
	rules and their later unification within a process constraint base.
	Separating process constraints from domain rules can lead to significant
	reduction of compliance checking effort. Unification enables consistency
	checks and optimizations as well as maintenance and evolution of
	the constraint base on the other side.},

	are, for example, often required to share resources such as printers
	or centrifuges, the necessary instance synchronization is not supported
	by most process engines. While existing (scarcely supported) patterns
	deal with the intra-process synchronization of activities, a model
	for a more generic synchronization mechanism is still missing. The
	contribution of this paper is two-fold. (1) We introduce a generic
	model to describe the state transitions of process instances at runtime,
	and based on this model (2) define a subscription based event / voting
	mechanism that enables arbitrary synchronization within and between
	running instances. In order to demonstrate the validity of our approach,
	we will conduct an extensive evaluation against existing synchronization
	patterns, as well as describe a generic rule engine prototype that
	implements the presented approach.},

  abstract = {Business processes today are supported by process-driven service oriented
	architectures. Due to the increasing importance of compliance of
	an organization with regulatory requirements and internal policies,
	there is a need for appropriate techniques to monitor organizational
	information systems as they execute business processes. Event-based
	monitoring of processes is one of the ways to provide runtime process-state
	information. This type of monitoring, however, has limitations mostly
	related to the type and amount of information available in events
	and pro- cess engines. We propose a novel approach ? model-aware
	monitoring of business processes ? to address these limitations.
	Emitted events contain unique identifiers of models that can be retrieved
	dynamically during runtime from a model-aware repository and service
	environment (MORSE). The size of the events is kept small and patterns
	of events that signify interesting occurrences are identified through
	complex event processing and are signaled to interesting components
	such as a business intelligence. To illustrate our approach we present
	an industry case study where we have applied this generic infrastructure
	for the compliance monitoring of business processes},

  month = apr,
  abstract = {Business Process Compliance {(BPC)} has gained significant momentum
	in research and practice during the last years. Although many approaches
	address {BPC}, they mostly assume the existence of some kind of unified
	base of process constraints and focus on their verification over
	the business processes. However, it remains unclear how such an inte-
	grated process constraint base can be built up, even though this
	con- stitutes the essential prerequisite for all further compliance
	checks. In addition, the heterogeneity of process constraints has
	been neglected so far. Without identification and separation of process
	constraints from domain rules as well as unification of process constraints,
	the success- ful {IT} support of {BPC} will not be possible. In this
	technical report we introduce a unified representation framework
	that enables the identifica- tion of process constraints from domain
	rules and their later unification within a process constraint base.
	Separating process constraints from domain rules can lead to significant
	reduction of compliance checking effort. Unification enables consistency
	checks and optimizations as well as maintenance and evolution of
	the constraint base on the other side.},

	by most process engines. While existing (scarcely supported) patterns
	deal with the intra-process synchronization of activities, a model
	for a more generic synchronization mechanism is still missing. The
	contribution of this paper is two-fold. (1) We introduce a generic
	model to describe the state transitions of process instances at runtime,
	and based on this model (2) define a subscription based event / voting
	mechanism that enables arbitrary synchronization within and between
	running instances. In order to demonstrate the validity of our approach,
	we will conduct an extensive evaluation against existing synchronization
	patterns, as well as describe a generic rule engine prototype that
	implements the presented approach.},

  abstract = {One approach to secure systems is through the analysis of audit trails.
	An audit trail is a record of all events that take place in a system
	and across a network, i.e., it provides a trace of user/system actions
	so that security events can be related to the actions of a specific
	individual or system component. Audit trails can be inspected for
	the presence or absence of certain patterns. This paper advocates
	the use of process mining techniques to analyze audit trails for
	security violations. It is shown how a specific algorithm, called
	the [alpha]-algorithm, can be used to support security efforts at
	various levels ranging from low-level intrusion detection to high-level
	fraud prevention.},

	to check the conformance of predefined process models, and to extend
	such models with information about bottlenecks, decisions, and resource
	usage. These techniques are driven by observed events rather than
	hand-made models. Event logs are used to learn and enrich process
	models. By replaying history using the model, it is possible to establish
	a precise relationship between events and model elements. This relationship
	can be used to check conformance and to analyze performance. For
	example, it is possible to diagnose deviations from the modeled behavior.
	The severity of each deviation can be quantified. Moreover, the relationship
	established during replay and the timestamps in the event log can
	be combined to show bottlenecks. These examples illustrate the importance
	of maintaining a proper alignment between event log and process model.
	Therefore, we elaborate on the realization of such alignments and
	their application to conformance checking and performance analysis.

	Basically, while modeling a business process the business analyst
	specifies as well the security and compliance requirements the business
	process should comply to. By pressing a button, these requirements
	are validated and the results are presented in a graphical format

	and industrially viable approach in which the security validation
	business logic is handled server-side ({SVaaS} Server) in the Cloud,
	while the client-side user interface that business analysts use is
	handled by a light-weight {SVaaS} Connector. As proof-of-concept
	we created a {SVaaS} prototype in which the {SVaaS} Server is deployed
	on the {SAP} {NetWeaver} Cloud and two {SVaaS} Connectors are built
	to enable two well-known {BPMN} tools, {SAP} {NetWeaver} {BPM} and

	monitoring is considered an important building block to support business
	process compliance. Key to the practical application of a monitoring
	framework will be its ability to reveal and pinpoint violations of

	this context, we propose a compliance monitoring framework that tackles
	three major challenges. As a compliance rule can become activated
	multiple times within a process execution, monitoring only its overall
	enforcement can be insufficient to assess and deal with compliance
	violations. Therefore, our approach enables to monitor each activation
	of a compliance rule individually. In case of violations, we are
	able to derive the particular root cause, which is helpful to apply
	specific remedy strategies. Even if a rule activation is not yet
	violated, the framework can provide assistance in proactively enforcing

	based on linear temporal logic and colored automata. The framework
	continuously verifies compliance with respect to a predefined constraint
	model. Our approach is able to provide meaningful diagnostics even
	after a constraint is violated. This is important as in reality people
	and organizations will deviate and in many situations it is not desirable
	or even impossible to circumvent constraint violations. As demonstrated
	in this paper, there are several approaches to recover after the
	first constraint violation. Traditional approaches that simply check
	constraints are unable to recover after the first violation and still
	foresee (inevitable) future violations. The framework has been implemented
	in the process mining tool {ProM.}},

	intuitive diagnostics explaining deviations at the level of alignments.
	The approach can also handle resource-based and data-based compliance
	rules and is supported by {ProM} plug-ins. The applicability of the

  abstract = {In enterprise resource planning ({ERP)} environments the audit of
	business process compliance is a complex task as audit relevant context
	information about the {ERP} system like application controls ({ACs)}
	need to be considered to derive comprehensive audit results. Current
	compliance checking approaches neglect such information as it is
	not readily available in process models. Even if {ACs} are automatically
	analysed with audit software, the results still need to be linked
	to related processes. By now, this linking is not methodically supported.
	To address this gap this paper presents a method to automatically
	enrich process models with audit relevant information about {ACs.}
	The method consists of three phases: process model construction,
	automated analysis of {ACs}, and model enrichment. It utilizes two
	existing artefacts and combines them to provide a comprehensive basis
	for compliance checking. Moreover, the enriched process models can
	support auditors in conducting process audits in {ERP} environments.},

	organisations is still a challenging task due to compliance requirements
	with regulatory policies that can vary across states and countries,

	the same regulatory policies, each organisation can interpret and

	management solution for {EHR} systems. It allows healthcare organisations
	to define their own security and regulatory compliance requirements
	for accessing and sharing healthcare data, and enables policy enforcement
	while sharing data with other organisations. The policy requirements
	are expressed in the form of business processes that govern the access
	and sharing of data between people and systems. The business process
	operations are mapped into lowlevel operations on internal and
	remote record stores and policy enforcement points. We have implemented
	a prototype system that supports the proposed approach and integrated
	it with {OpenMRS}, an open source electronic medical record system,
	using which we have defined and enforced some realworld regulations
	and organisations' policies for data sharing.},

	architectures. Due to the increasing importance of compliance of
	an organization with regulatory requirements and internal policies,
	there is a need for appropriate techniques to monitor organizational
	information systems as they execute business processes. Event-based
	monitoring of processes is one of the ways to provide runtime process-state
	information. This type of monitoring, however, has limitations mostly
	related to the type and amount of information available in events
	and pro- cess engines. We propose a novel approach ? model-aware
	monitoring of business processes ? to address these limitations.
	Emitted events contain unique identifiers of models that can be retrieved
	dynamically during runtime from a model-aware repository and service
	environment (MORSE). The size of the events is kept small and patterns
	of events that signify interesting occurrences are identified through
	complex event processing and are signaled to interesting components
	such as a business intelligence. To illustrate our approach we present
	an industry case study where we have applied this generic infrastructure
	for the compliance monitoring of business processes},

  abstract = {A fundamental challenge for any process-aware information system is
	to ensure compliance of modeled and executed business processes with
	imposed compliance rules stemming from guidelines, standards and
	laws. Such compliance rules usually refer to multiple process perspectives
	including control flow, time, resources, data, and interactions with
	business partners. On one hand, compliance rules should be comprehensible
	for domain experts who must define and apply them. On the other,
	they should have a precise semantics such that they can be automatically
	processed. In this context, providing a visual compliance rule language
	seems promising as it allows hiding formal details and offers an
	intuitive way of modeling. So far, visual compliance rule languages
	have focused on the control flow perspective, but lack adequate support
	for the other perspectives. To remedy this drawback, this paper provides
	an approach that extends visual compliance rule languages with the
	ability to consider data, time, resources, and partner interactions
	when modeling business process compliance rules. Overall, this extension
	will foster business process compliance support in practice.},

  month = apr,
  abstract = {Business Process Compliance {(BPC)} has gained significant momentum
	in research and practice during the last years. Although many approaches
	address {BPC}, they mostly assume the existence of some kind of unified
	base of process constraints and focus on their verification over
	the business processes. However, it remains unclear how such an inte-
	grated process constraint base can be built up, even though this
	con- stitutes the essential prerequisite for all further compliance
	checks. In addition, the heterogeneity of process constraints has
	been neglected so far. Without identification and separation of process
	constraints from domain rules as well as unification of process constraints,
	the success- ful {IT} support of {BPC} will not be possible. In this
	technical report we introduce a unified representation framework
	that enables the identifica- tion of process constraints from domain
	rules and their later unification within a process constraint base.
	Separating process constraints from domain rules can lead to significant
	reduction of compliance checking effort. Unification enables consistency
	checks and optimizations as well as maintenance and evolution of
	the constraint base on the other side.},

	by most process engines. While existing (scarcely supported) patterns
	deal with the intra-process synchronization of activities, a model
	for a more generic synchronization mechanism is still missing. The
	contribution of this paper is two-fold. (1) We introduce a generic
	model to describe the state transitions of process instances at runtime,
	and based on this model (2) define a subscription based event / voting
	mechanism that enables arbitrary synchronization within and between
	running instances. In order to demonstrate the validity of our approach,
	we will conduct an extensive evaluation against existing synchronization
	patterns, as well as describe a generic rule engine prototype that

  abstract = {Business processes today are supported by process-driven service oriented
	architectures. Due to the increasing importance of compliance of
	an organization with regulatory requirements and internal policies,
	there is a need for appropriate techniques to monitor organizational
	information systems as they execute business processes. Event-based
	monitoring of processes is one of the ways to provide runtime process-state
	information. This type of monitoring, however, has limitations mostly
	related to the type and amount of information available in events
	and pro- cess engines. We propose a novel approach ? model-aware
	monitoring of business processes ? to address these limitations.
	Emitted events contain unique identifiers of models that can be retrieved
	dynamically during runtime from a model-aware repository and service
	environment (MORSE). The size of the events is kept small and patterns
	of events that signify interesting occurrences are identified through
	complex event processing and are signaled to interesting components
	such as a business intelligence. To illustrate our approach we present
	an industry case study where we have applied this generic infrastructure
	for the compliance monitoring of business processes},

  year = {2011},
  month = apr,
  abstract = {Business Process Compliance {(BPC)} has gained significant momentum
	in research and practice during the last years. Although many approaches
	address {BPC}, they mostly assume the existence of some kind of unified
	base of process constraints and focus on their verification over
	the business processes. However, it remains unclear how such an inte-
	grated process constraint base can be built up, even though this
	con- stitutes the essential prerequisite for all further compliance
	checks. In addition, the heterogeneity of process constraints has
	been neglected so far. Without identification and separation of process
	constraints from domain rules as well as unification of process constraints,
	the success- ful {IT} support of {BPC} will not be possible. In this
	technical report we introduce a unified representation framework
	that enables the identifica- tion of process constraints from domain
	rules and their later unification within a process constraint base.
	Separating process constraints from domain rules can lead to significant
	reduction of compliance checking effort. Unification enables consistency
	checks and optimizations as well as maintenance and evolution of
	the constraint base on the other side.},
