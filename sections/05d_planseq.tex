\subsection{Plan Recognition}
\textit{Plan recognition} predicts an agent's plans based on its observed actions. In such scenarios, it is commonly assumed that the possible activities can be exhaustively enumerating in finite time \cite{RamirezG09}. 

Although 
an unexpected context change could make the agent change its plan to $\sigma''$. As the already-executed plan $\sigma'$ cannot be retracted, the resulting plan after the context change $\overline{\sigma}$ shares intermediate features between $\sigma''$ and $\sigma'$ \cite{FoxGLS06}, which differences can be described by plan repairs.
