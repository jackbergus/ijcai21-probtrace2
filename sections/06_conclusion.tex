The presented approach to probabilistic trace alignment via $k$NN allows users to choose among the top-$k$ alignments instead of providing them with a single one. Experiments show that approximated top-$k$ rankings represent a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency especially when the model generates several traces. In the future, we aim at systematically applying our approach to conformance checking, biological sequence analysis, and plan recognition. In particular, we will study probabilistic alignments over fuzzy-labeled nodes, generalizing our technique to noisy walks in plan recognition for non-rational agents \cite{RamirezG10}. We will also tackle efficiency and accuracy and compare our approach to Viterbi decodings for top-$k$ alignments.
%Last, we intend to develop TG embeddings for POMDPs.
