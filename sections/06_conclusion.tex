We have presented an approach to probabilistic trace alignment via $k$NN.
The approach balances between the model trace's likelihood  and its alignment cost by providing the top-$k$ 
alignments instead of a single output. Experiments show that the approximated top-$k$ ranking provides a good 
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency especially when the reference model generates several traces.
Future works will investigate the probabilistic alignment over fuzzy-labeled nodes and declarative process models, thus 
generalizing the proposed approach to noisy walks in plan recognition for non-rational agents \cite{RamirezG10}. We will also improve 
the efficiency and accuracy by %of our approach by intervening on the embedding and the algorithmic strategies, such as 
running  Viterbi decodings to generate top-$k$ paths \cite{577040}. Last, we will also 
investigate the possibility of generalating the embedding approach to POMDPs.
