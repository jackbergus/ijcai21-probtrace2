\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented an approach to probabilistic trace alignment via $k$NN, balancing between the model trace's likelihood  and its alignment cost, and by providing top-$k$ 
alignments instead of a single output. Experiments show that approximated top-$k$ rankings provide a good 
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency especially when the model generates several traces.
In the future, we aim at systematically applying  our approach in conformance checking, biological sequence analysis, and plan recognition. In particular,  we want to study  probabilistic alignments over fuzzy-labeled nodes, generalizing our technique to noisy walks in plan recognition for non-rational agents \cite{RamirezG10}. We also want to tackle efficiency and accuracy and compare our approach to %of our approach by intervening on the embedding and the algorithmic strategies, such as 
  Viterbi decodings for top-$k$ alignments. Last, we intend to develop TG embeddings for  POMDPs.
