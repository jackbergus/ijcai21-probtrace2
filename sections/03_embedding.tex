\section{Probabilistic Trace Alignment Pipeline}
We now employ the models and techniques described in Section~\ref{sec:models} to provide the main contribution of this paper, namely a technique for computing probabilistic trace alignments. More specifically, our approach takes as input
\begin{inparaenum}[\it (i)]
\item a reference model represented as an \uswn $\net$,
\item a minimum, positive probability threshold $\pmin \in (0,1]$
\item a trace $\trace$ of interest,
\end{inparaenum}
and returns a ranking over all the $\net$-traces having a probability greater than or equal to $\pmin$, based on a combined consideration of their probability values (probabilistic component) and their distance to $\trace$ (alignment component).

\subsection{Computation pipeline}
Our technique is realized through the pipeline shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:pipe}, consisting of the following steps.
%
In step 1, the reachability graph $\rg{\net}$ of $\net$ is constructed.
%
In step 2,  $\rg{\net}$ is converted into a corresponding transition graph $\tg_{\rg{\net}}$ that preserves model traces and their probabilities. We omit the details of this conversion, due to lack of space and the fact that it employs well-known techniques used to \emph{shift labels} from transitions to states while preserving the behavior encoded by a transition system. \figurename~\ref{fig:orig} shows the result of this conversion when applied to the reachability graph in \figurename~\ref{fig:rg}.


In step 3, the transition graph $\tg_{\rg{\net}}$ is processed applying a \emph{$\hidden$-closure} that compiles away
$\tau$-transitions. This results into a new transition graph $\closed{\tg_{\rg{\net}}}$ that on the one hand only retains $\hidden$ labels only in the initial and accepting states while for the rest exclusively operating over visible labels in $\tasks$, and, on the other, continues to preserve model traces and their probabilities. Also in this case we omit the details, as the transformation relies on well-known automata-based techniques for removing $\epsilon$-moves. The only non-trivial observation is that, even in our case where probabilities are present, all $\tau$ transitions can still be removed thanks to the working hypothesis done for \uswn{s} in Section~\ref{subsec:spn}, for which no loops can contain only $\tau$ transitions. As a result of this step, the transition graph in \figurename~\ref{fig:orig} results in that of \figurename~\ref{fig:closed}.


In step 4, the $\hidden$-closed transition graph $\closed{\tg_{\rg{\net}}}$ is \unravelled, so as to collect all the model traces that have a probability of at least $\pmin$. To do so, we rely on a key property that $\closed{\tg_{\rg{\net}}}$ inherits from the fact that it results from an \uswn. Since an \uswn has a Workflow net as underlying control-flow structure, no loop can be executed without strictly decreasing the resulting probability. This means that all valid sequences with a resulting probability of at least $\pmin$ can be enumerated and returned in a set. The so-obtained sequences are then combined by merging those that produce the same trace, summing up their probabilities, thus obtaining the set of all the traces having a probability greater than or equal to $\pmin$, $\ptraces{\closed{\tg_{\rg{\net}}}}{\pmin}$. The closure operation also implies that the notion of model trace collapses with the one of run modulo removing the initial and the final $\tau$ labels attached to the initial and accepting nodes.


%$\closed{\tg_{\rg{\net}}}$ preserves model traces and their probabilities while working only over visible tasks in $\tasks$;
% this transition graph is unraveled c we apply a probabilistic alignment technique that ranks all such model traces according to their probability and their similarity to $\trace$.
%
%The pipeline has the following phases: after representing the USWN as a graph of all the sequentially scheduled transitions
%(\S\ref{sec:seqZ}), we shift the labels from the edges towards the nodes while preserving the set of probabilistic traces
%(\S\ref{sec:LSift}) and minimize the graph representation by removing the $\tau$-labeled nodes while preserving the
%trace probability (\S\ref{sec:clos}).
The last step takes the so-obtained model traces and ranks them by considering their probabilities and the similarity with the trace $\trace$ of interest. In \figurename~\ref{fig:pipe}, this is shown as a black-box. As we describe in detail next, we have implemented this last step in two alternative ways: one computationally demanding but guaranteeing to produce an optimal ranking, the other more efficient but providing approximate ranking without optimality guarantees.
%\todo{Ho tagliato la descrizione che c'era dopo. Al limite la incorporerei nella rispettiva sottosezione.}
%We later discuss how to rank traces in the exact and approximated scenarios by reducing the alignment process to a k-nearest
%neighbour problem. While the exact trace alignment requires to perform the alignment process each time a novel trace $\sigma^*$ is
%introduced (\S\ref{subsec:exbkptap}), the approximated alignment can split the alignment into a preliminary loading phase and a
%query phase. In the former, each stochastic trace from the USWN is represented as a vector (\S\ref{subsec:ate}), and in the latter the to-be-aligned trace $\sigma^*$ is first represented as a vector and then compared to all the other vectorial representations.

\endinput
%
We can show that the TG obtained in Definition \ref{def:transf} preserves the same set of probabilistic traces associated by the reachability graph. The proof is omitted due to the lack of space.

\begin{example}
\figurename~\ref{fig:lmc} shows the TG obtained from the reachability graph in \figurename~\ref{fig:rg}. Nodes are labeled with the firing
transition labels (in green), and edges preserve the probabilistic information from the reachability graph (in red). Intuitively, when a
new initial node \textit{\textbf{i}} is inserted, we preserve all the initial probabilistic choices that a transition is fired from an initial
marking $M$, while the intermediate edges inherit the probabilistic choice of the firing transition from the subsequent choices. When
a new final node \textit{\textbf{f}} is added, such edges always have probability $1$, and thus do not interfere with the
initial traces' probability.
\end{example}

\subsection{$\tau$-closure}\label{sec:clos}
The $\tau$-closure process has two main purposes: first, reduce the size of the previously generated TG by removing all
$\tau$-labeled nodes \texttt{\color{blue}w} and preserving the connection between  the nodes \texttt{\color{blue}u}
from its ingoing edges   $\texttt{\color{blue}u}\xrightarrow{\color{violet}\rho}\texttt{\color{blue}w}$ with the nodes \texttt{\color{blue}v} from its ingoing edges   $\texttt{\color{blue}w}\xrightarrow{\color{violet}\rho'}\texttt{\color{blue}v}$ by establishing new edges $\texttt{\color{blue}u}\xrightarrow{\color{violet}\rho\rho'}\texttt{\color{blue}v}$. $\tau$-labeled initial (or accepting) nodes are removed iff they have only one outgoing (ingoing) edge with probability $1$.

\begin{example}\todo{Is it now ok?}
	The $\tau$-closure removes the non-initial and non-accepting nodes within an automaton, while preserving the probabilistic trace equivalence of the two automata. Let us suppose to apply the $\tau$-closure to the automata in \figurename~\ref{fig:orig}: node \texttt{\color{blue}10} is removed alongside its associated edges, and new edges $\texttt{\color{blue}3}\xrightarrow{\color{violet}\rho_{65}}\texttt{\color{blue}4}$ and $\texttt{\color{blue}3}\xrightarrow{\color{violet}\rho_{6f}}\texttt{\color{blue}5}$ are introduced. The resulting TG $P$ is represented with the same graphical depiction \figurename~\ref{fig:closed}.
\end{example}
%
Consequently, it is always possible to minimize a TG  via $\tau$-closure, so that the only nodes labeled as $\tau$
are the source and the target nodes and the set of weighted traces is preserved. From now on, we consider only minimized TGs.

\subsection{Unfolder}\label{sec:unrav}
%Being that both the graph isomorphism problem is NP-Complete and the
Since TGs are fully characterized by the set of the probabilistic traces that they generate,  we say that two TGs are
(probabilistic-trace) equivalent iff they share the same set of weighted traces. In particular, we denote as $\mathcal{W}_p^n(P)$ the set of all the weighted traces in $P$ having at least probability $p$ and maximum length $n$. Under these assumptions, the probabilistic trace equivalence is deterministic.

\begin{example}
	The set $\mathcal{W}_0^{\aleph_0}(P^*)$ of weighted traces of the TG in \figurename~\ref{fig:orig} is
%	The TG in \figurename~\ref{fig:orig} has the following set $\mathcal{W}_0^{\aleph_0}(P^*)$ of weighted traces:
$$\set{\braket{\underbrace{\color{green}a\dots a}_{n},{\color{violet}\pa\pc^n\pf}}|n\in \mathbb{N}_{>0}}\cup \set{\braket{{\color{green}c}\underbrace{\color{green}a\dots a}_{n},{\color{violet}\pb\pd\pc^n\pf}}|n\in \mathbb{N}_{>0}}\cup\{\braket{{\color{green}cb},{\color{violet}\pb\pe}}\}$$
After the $\tau$-closure process, $\mathcal{W}_0^{\aleph_0}(P^*)=\mathcal{W}_0^{\aleph_0}(P)$, so the two TGs are (probabilistic-trace) equivalent.
\end{example}
