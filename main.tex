\begin{abstract}
%Conformance checking techniques verify whether the observed behavior recorded in an event log matches a modeled behavior. This type of analysis is crucial, because often real process executions deviate from the reference process models. Currently, one of the most common approaches to conformance checking is based on trace alignments. 
Alignments provide sophisticated diagnostics that pinpoint deviations in a trace with respect to a process model and their severity. However, approaches based on trace alignments use crisp process models as reference and recent probabilistic conformance checking approaches check the degree of conformance of an event log with respect to a stochastic process model instead of finding trace alignments. In this paper, for the first time, we provide a conformance checking approach based on trace alignments using stochastic Workflow nets. Conceptually, this requires to handle the two possibly contrasting forces of the cost of the alignment on the one hand and the likelihood of the model trace with respect to which the alignment is computed on the other.
%If the cost of the alignment is too high, even if the considered model trace is very likely, applying too many changes in the original trace is not always the best option. The proposed approach has been evaluated using a real-life event log pertaining to the treatment of the sepsis disease in a hospital.
