Sepsis is a life threatening condition typically caused by an infection. One case represents the pathway through the hospital. The events were recorded by the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system of the hospital. There are about 1000 cases with in total 15,000 events that were recorded for 16 different activities. Moreover, 39 data attributes are recorded, e.g., the group responsible for the activity, the results of tests and information from checklists. Events and attribute values have been anonymized. The time stamps of events have been randomized, but the time between events within a trace has not been altered.}, publisher={4TU.ResearchData}, author={Mannhardt, Felix}, year={2016}, month={Dec} }
